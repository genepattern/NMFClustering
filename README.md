# NMFClustering

This github repository has been superceded by https://github.com/genepattern/nmf-gpu

This is a C-code re-implementation of the NMFConsensus module that runs on GPU accelerated nodes on the San Diego Super Computer Center's Expanse system.  It may be viable on other GPU environments but it has not been tested for portability and there are not immediate plans to do so.
